  <div class="article">
    <p>The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is one of the most ubiquitous
measures of accuracy in the machine learning literature. Originally developed 
for signal detection during World War II, the curve provides a graphical
representation of a predictive model's accuracy by showing the true positive and
false positive rates for a model at various predictive thresholds. These
thresholds, also referred to as cutoff points, serve to divide observations
based on their predicted probabilities. For example, a threshold of .5 means
that the model classifies observations with predicted probabilities greater
than or equal to .5 as positives, and those with predicted probabilities less
than .5 as negatives. Because it the ideal cutoff point varies based on The
problem at hand, the ROC curve provides a means of determining where the best
cutoff point is. </p>
<p>The main metric derived from the ROC curve is the area under the curve (AUC) 
score, which, as the name suggests, is the area of the graph contained under 
the ROC curve. The ideal AUC is 1.0, which means the model correctly classifies
all of the positive observations without any false positives. An AUC of .5 
indicates that the model is no better than a coin flip. The AUC is often used
as a means of model comparison. The intuition is that models with a higher AUC
are doing a better job of assigning higher predicted probabilities to positive
observations and lower predicted probabilities to negative observations.</p>
<p>The figure above shows ROC curves comparing modesl for predicting Militarized
Interstate Incidents [1]. With AUC scores all above .9, it looks like the models
are all very good. This is when ROC curves become misleading. The axes only 
measure the rates of positive and negative observations, not the actual numbers. 
This is fine for a balanced dataset, but it is problematic for underbalanced 
datasets like the one here. In this case, there are about 300 positive
observations and over 100,000 negative observations. Suddenly, achieving a true
positive rate of .8 with a false positive rate of .2 doesn't look so good. A 
false postive rate of just .01 means 1,000 false positives. This is an unacceptable
number if we are only getting 100 or so true positives in exchange. </p>
<p>This issue also renders the ROC curves usefulness for model comparison irrelevant
for unbalanced data. Even if one model has a better AUC than another, it does
not mean much if that is due to better performance when the false positive rate
is greater than .1. The number of true positives are already overwhelmed by 
the number of false positives. Performance past this point is irrelevant. Really, 
the best model in this case would be the one that achieves the highest true 
positive rate, while maintaining a false positive rate of 0. </p>
<p>For conflict researchers who work almost exclusively with unbalanced data, either
avoid using ROC curves and related AUC curves as metrics, or include the total
number of positive and negative cases in the sample as a note attached to the
figure. Fortunately, there are alternatives. I'll discuss one of these, the 
precision-recall curve, in another post.</p>
